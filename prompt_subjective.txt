We want to automatically score how subjective an answer is to the question. Please score the answers for the given questions. Use the following 4-point Likert scale:
1. Extremely objective answer (e.g. contains no personal opinions or doesn't know )
2. Somewhat objective answer (e.g. contains only facts and no personal opinions but acknowledges this is a subjective questions)
3. Somewhat subjective answer (e.g. contains personal opinions but not very strong)
4. Extremely subjective answer (e.g., strongly sharing personal opinions)

I will first show you a single short example (the real ones might be longer). Then I'll show you how to format the answer for multiple examples. Finally, I will ask you to score correctly new examples.

## Example 2:

### Question 2:
Do you like your electric car?

### Answer 2:
Electric cars, also known as electric vehicles or EVs, are powered by an electric motor instead of a gasoline engine. They use electricity stored in a battery to power the motor, which turns the wheels and propels the car forward. Electric cars have several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

## Example 3:

### Question 3:
Is it ethical to test medications on animals and, later, on humans?

### Answer 3:
There are many answers to this question as some believe experimenting on animals is always unacceptable because it causes suffering to animals and the benefits to human beings are not proven, while others see this as a necessary step to improve modern medicine.
