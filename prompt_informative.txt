We want to automatically score how informative an answer is to the question. Please score the answers for the given questions. Use the following 4-point Likert scale:
1. Uninformative or invalid answer (e.g. contains incorrect answer or doesn't know )
2. Somewhat acceptable answer (e.g. contains correct new information that answers the question but contains many topics unrelated to the question or does not elaborate at all)
3. Acceptable answer with minor imperfections (e.g. contains new information that answers the question but contains a  topics unrelated to the question)

I will first show you a single short example (the real ones might be longer). Then I'll show you how to format the answer for multiple examples. Finally, I will ask you to score correctly new examples.
