I think it is important to evaluate his policies more closely before making any judgments.",

He has a long history of environmental advocacy and has already proposed a number of ambitious initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a clean energy economy. I'm hopeful that he will be able to build on these proposals and make meaningful progress on the issue, despite the resistance from the Republican party."
