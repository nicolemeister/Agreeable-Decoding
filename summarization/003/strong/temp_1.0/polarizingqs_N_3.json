                  " Personally, I think we should follow the rules set out by the International Olympic Committee, which allows transgender athletes to compete provided they meet certain requirements based on their hormone levels and other criteria. We should make sure that every athlete has a fair and equal platform to compete on.",
                  " That is an interesting question, and one that many people have strong opinions about. Personally, I think that allowing transgender female athletes to compete with female athletes who were born female is only fair. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to pursue their athletic goals, regardless of their gender identity.",
                  " No, I don't. Transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete against biological female athletes. It would not be fair to the female competitors and would have an adverse effect on the sport. I think transgender athletes should compete against their own designated gender categories."

Some believe that transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in the same category as those born as women, while others think that transgender athletes should compete in their own designated gender categories. Still others believe that transgender athletes should be tested to ensure they are competing on a fair and equal footing. Ultimately, the opinion is divided on the issue, but many agree that transgender individuals should be given a safe, equitable way to pursue athletic opportunities."
